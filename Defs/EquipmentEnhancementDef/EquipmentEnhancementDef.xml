    <!-- Hello there! If you're looking at this file then you're probably either curious, or trying to change the
         balance of PsiTech. So here's how this works. -->
    <!-- This def is sort of fake in that it's just a way to serialize data in XML. It doesn't define anything real. -->
    <!-- This def defines the stat multipliers for Psychic equipment in PsiTech. -->
    <!-- Now, because of the synchronicity system the numbers here are not the actual multipliers, they just define them -->
    <!-- The actual multipliers are determined by the equation mult = 1 + mod * sync -->
    <!-- For example, take the stat RangedWeapon_Cooldown. -->
    <!-- Say we have a synchronicity of 1.5 or 150%, and a "mod" value of -0.25, meaning a 25% decrease in cooldown per 
         100% sync. -->
    <!-- By the given formula, we would have a multiplier of 62.5% to our cooldown. -->
    <!-- Note that synchronicity can scale to 200% meaning that the numbers here are half of the max values. -->
    <!-- There's also the mods for psychic apparel, the ShellMods and OverheadMods. These are not modified by 
         synchronicity, so what you see is what you get. Unlike weapons, those mods are offsets. -->
    <!-- Also note that mod lists are static, meaning that there should only ever be one EquipmentEnhancementDef or
         things will start to break. -->
    <!-- Well, that's not totally true, it's a bit more complicated than that but don't worry about it. -->
